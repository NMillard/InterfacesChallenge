# Interfaces Challenge
A very small, simple application built using interfaces.  

## Design guidelines
The WebClient project must only take a dependency on interfaces, but it's allowed to have its own classes, such as Controllers, etc.  
The WebClient should only expose interfaces - domain classes must not be exposed directly.
